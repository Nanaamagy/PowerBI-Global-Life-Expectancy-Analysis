## ðŸ“ŒProject Overview

A Power BI exploration of global health and socio-economic indicators (2000â€“2015) to understand how mortality, immunization, and economic context relate to life expectancy across countries.

## ðŸ“ŠData Source

Data was sourced from Kaggle

## ðŸ› Tools

Power BI (data modeling, DAX measures, interactive visuals).

## Data Processing

Imported and profiled multiple indicator tables; standardized country/status fields.

Cleaned missing/erroneous values and normalized units (K, M, %).

Built a star-schema model with Calendar & Country dimensions for time/status slicing.

Created DAX measures (e.g., Total Adult Mortality, Avg. Life Expectancy, % by Status).

Added slicers (Country, Year/Status) and tooltips; applied consistent typography and color.

## ðŸ§ Skills Demonstrated

Data transformation â€¢ Data processing â€¢ Data analysis â€¢ Visualization â€¢ Critical thinking â€¢ Problem-solving.

## ðŸŽ¯Objectives

Track life expectancy trends over time.

Compare mortality burden (infant & under-5) across high-impact countries.

Examine immunization distributions.

Connect socio-economic context (GDP, expenditure, income composition) to health outcomes.

## Data Analysis & Visualization

Life expectancy rises steadily to 71.4 years by 2015 after a dip in the early 2000s.

Infant deaths (Top 6): India (~14.0K), Nigeria (5.2K), China (4.6K), Pakistan (4.4K), Indonesia (2.3K), Bangladesh (1.7K).

Status mix: About 85.8% of observations are from developing contexts

Ranks countries by under-5 mortality, shows immunization distribution (Polio, HepB, Measles), tracks adult mortality over time, and lists top life-expectancy countries

Under-5 mortality (Top ranks): India (18.5K) and Nigeria (8.3K) lead the global burden.

Immunization mix: Polio â‰ˆ 83.6%, HepB â‰ˆ 8.6%, Measles â‰ˆ 7.9% of recorded immunization cases.

Adult mortality peaks in the late 2000s, then declines into the 2010s.

Highest life expectancy (sample): Ireland (83.44), Canada (82.23), France (82.21), Italy (82.15), Spain (82.02).

Connects macroeconomics to health: global GDP trend, total health expenditure by country, and income composition by development status.

GDP climbs through ~2012, then softens slightly.

Total health expenditure (highest shown): Afghanistan ($132.0), Maldives ($123.6), Bhutan ($80.2), Nepal ($72.0), India (~$47.9).

Income composition: ~58.4% developing vs. 41.6% developed.

Summary

Global Life Expectancy: After an early-2000s dip, average life expectancy rises steadily to 71.4 years by 2015.

Mortality & Burden:

Infant deaths (Top 6): India (~14.0K), Nigeria (5.2K), China (4.6K), Pakistan (4.4K), Indonesia (2.3K), Bangladesh (1.7K).

Under-5 mortality (Top 6): India (~18.5K) and Nigeria (~8.3K) remain highest.

Adult mortality peaks in the late 2000s, then trends downward into the 2010s.

Immunization Mix: Polio accounts for the largest share (~83.6%) of recorded immunization cases; HepB (~8.6%) and Measles (~7.9%) are smaller shares.

Country Status: Majority of observations are from developing contexts (~85.8%).

Top Life Expectancy (sample): Ireland (83.44), Canada (82.23), France (82.21), Italy (82.15), Spain (82.02).

Socio-Economic Context:

Global GDP generally climbs through 2012 before softening.

Highest reported total health expenditure appears in Afghanistan ($132.0), Maldives ($123.6), Bhutan ($80.2), Nepal ($72.0), India (~$47.9).

Income composition skews toward developing contexts (~58.4%) vs. developed (~41.6%).

## Insights

Progress with gaps: Life expectancy improved overall, but the burden of infant/under-5 mortality is concentrated in a handful of populous countries.

Immunization focus: Polio dominates reported immunization activity, aligning with eradication efforts; measles and HepB remain non-trivial shares.

Context matters: Countries classed as developing represent most observations and typically face higher mortality alongside tighter resource envelopes.

Economic linkage: Periods of rising GDP coincide with gradual gains in life expectancy, suggesting macro-economic tailwinds for healthâ€”though not uniformly.

## âœ…Recommendations

Target hotspots: Prioritize high-burden countries (e.g., India, Nigeria, Pakistan) with integrated maternal/child health interventions.

Broaden immunization balance: Sustain polio momentum while strengthening measles and HepB coverage to reduce under-5 mortality further.

Invest in primary care & data systems: Channel expenditure toward community health, surveillance, and timely data to sharpen local decisions.

Socio-economic levers: Pair health programs with poverty reduction, WASH, and education initiatives to compound life-expectancy gains.

Equity monitoring: Track outcomes by status (developed vs. developing) to close persistent mortality gaps.
